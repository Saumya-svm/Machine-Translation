# Machine-Translation

Basic Machine Translation using and Encoder-Decoder Network.

To-Do

- [ ] Add some more preprocessing to improve the model
- [ ] Yet to perform evaluation on Attention aided models and standard encoder-decoder models.
- [ ] Speed up custom training
- [ ] Figure out why custom training takes relatively more time to converge
- [ ] Create a model such that we can use tensorflow's in built training on a custom model and not perform custom training
- [X] Adding Attention layer
- [ ] Use transformers
